# Animal-app 

As a group, we must plan and develop an application that utilizes Wikipedia, Giphy, and Pixabay API’s to display animal related articles and images using dynamic html. 


## Requirements

* The project must be developed using a CSS framework other than Bootstrap, and must include at least two API's.

* The user must be able to click a highly visible and identifiable start button. 

* Then the user is presented with images and text representing various animal classes.

* When the user clicks on one of the images they are presented with another set of images and text representing various species in that class. 

* When an image is clicked, the user is presented with a Wikipedia article related to that species as well as several images. 

* The user also has the option to view previously searched animals and to start a new search.
