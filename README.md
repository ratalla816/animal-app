  ## Usage
  User Story:

  As a child, I Want to click a highly visible and identifiable start button. 
  Then I am presented with images and text representing various animal classes.
  When I click on one of the images I am presented with another set of images and text representing various species in that class. 
  When I click on an image, I am presented with a Wikipedia article related to that species as well as several images. I also have the option to view previously searched animals and to start a new search
